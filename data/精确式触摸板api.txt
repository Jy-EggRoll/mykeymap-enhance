TOUCHPAD_PARAMETERS structure (winuser.h)
 Important

Some information relates to a prerelease product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

Contains user touchpad settings and system information related to all detected touchpads.

 Note

The term "touchpad" refers to Precision Touchpads. The term "legacy touchpad" refers to older generation touchpads that report themselves to Windows as a mouse.

} TOUCHPAD_PARAMETERS, *PTOUCH_PAD_PARAMETERS, TOUCHPAD_PARAMETERS_V1, *PTOUCHPAD_PARAMETERS_V1;
Members
versionNumber

The version of the struct.

Caller must set to TOUCHPAD_PARAMETERS_LATEST_VERSION to use the latest version, or to TOUCHPAD_PARAMETERS_VERSION_[#] to use a specific version (). The version must be specified when both reading and writing settings.

 Note

TOUCHPAD_PARAMETERS_VERSION_1 is the only specific version of TOUCHPAD_PARAMETERS_VERSION_[#] currently defined.

maxSupportedContacts

The maximum number of simultaneous contacts (for the touchpad that supports the most) amongst all detected touchpads.1

legacyTouchpadFeatures

The supported features reported by detected legacy touchpads. This will be LEGACY_TOUCHPAD_FEATURE_NONE if no legacy touchpads are detected, or if the legacy touchpads do not support configuration through SPI_SETTOUCHPADPARAMETERS.1

touchpadPresent

A Precision Touchpad is detected.1

legacyTouchpadPresent

A legacy touchpad is detected.1

externalMousePresent

An external mouse is detected. See Precision touchpad tuning for information on exempting a mouse from being considered as external (for the purposes of this status field and behavior of the allowActiveWhenMousePresent setting).1

touchpadEnabled

Touchpad input is enabled.1

touchpadActive

Touchpad input is active. It is active if it is enabled, and either there is no external mouse detected or touchpad input has been configured to stay active despite the presence of an external mouse. This field does not indicate whether any touchpad is actively producing input.1

feedbackSupported

A detected touchpad supports haptic feedback.1

clickForceSupported

A detected touchpad supports haptic click force.1

Reserved1

allowActiveWhenMousePresent

Touchpad input can remain active if an external mouse is detected. When inactive, any input produced by a touchpad is ignored.2

feedbackEnabled

Haptic feedback is enabled on touchpads if supported.2

tapEnabled

Single-finger taps are enabled.2

tapAndDragEnabled

Tap-and-drag is enabled.2

twoFingerTapEnabled

Two-finger tap is enabled.2

rightClickZoneEnabled

Pressing the bottom-right corner of the touchpad results in a right-click instead of a left click.2

If the user has swapped their left and right mouse buttons (GetSystemMetrics(SM_SWAPBUTTON) is true), the right-click zone is mirrored horizontally to the bottom-left corner of the touchpad.

mouseAccelSettingHonored

Mouse motion produced by the touchpad honors the user's mouse acceleration setting (specified by SystemParametersInfo(SPI_GETMOUSE)). If false, the mouse motion always has acceleration applied.2

panEnabled

Two-finger panning is enabled.2

zoomEnabled

Two-finger zooming is enabled.2

scrollDirectionReversed

The direction content scrolls with two-finger panning is reversed. By default, the upward motion of contacts on the touchpad results in content scrolling downward while leftward motion of contacts results in content scrolling rightwards.2

Reserved2

sensitivityLevel

The touchpad sensitivity level. The more sensitive the touchpad, the less suppression of mouse input generation occurs after keyboard activity (see TOUCHPAD_SENSITIVITY_LEVEL enumeration).2

cursorSpeed

The rate at which the mouse motion produced by the touchpad moves the cursor. Valid values are 1-20, inclusive.2

feedbackIntensity

The relative intensity of the touchpad's haptic feedback (if supported). Valid values are 0-100, inclusive.2

clickForceSensitivity

The relative sensitivity of the touchpad's haptic click detection (if supported). Valid values are 0-100, inclusive.2

rightClickZoneWidth

The relative width of the touchpad right-click zone. Valid values are 0-100, inclusive. If non-zero, this value overrides the device configuration.2

rightClickZoneHeight

The relative height of the touchpad right-click zone. Valid values are 0-100, inclusive. If non-zero, this value overrides the device configuration.2

Remarks
All fields apply only to Precision Touchpads, with the exception of fields that specify "legacy touchpad" or are supported by the legacy touchpad as indicated by the legacyTouchpadFeatures field.

1 Represents the system information that can be used to help inform which user settings are applicable to the current device. They are ignored when calling SystemParametersInfo (A/W) with SPI_SETTOUCHPADPARAMETERS.

2 Represents user settings. Modifications to these fields will result in changing the user's settings when calling SystemParametersInfo (A/W) with SPI_SETTOUCHPADPARAMETERS.

 Important

Some information relates to a prerelease product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

Identifies values for the touchpad sensitivity setting.

Syntax
C++
typedef enum TOUCHPAD_SENSITIVITY_LEVEL {
  TOUCHPAD_SENSITIVITY_LEVEL_MOST_SENSITIVE = 0x00000000,
  TOUCHPAD_SENSITIVITY_LEVEL_HIGH_SENSITIVITY = 0x00000001,
  TOUCHPAD_SENSITIVITY_LEVEL_MEDIUM_SENSITIVITY = 0x00000002,
  TOUCHPAD_SENSITIVITY_LEVEL_LOW_SENSITIVITY = 0x00000003,
  TOUCHPAD_SENSITIVITY_LEVEL_LEAST_SENSITIVE = 0x00000004
} ;
Constants
 
TOUCHPAD_SENSITIVITY_LEVEL_MOST_SENSITIVE
Value: 0x00000000
The touchpad does not suppress mouse input generation after keyboard activity.
TOUCHPAD_SENSITIVITY_LEVEL_HIGH_SENSITIVITY
Value: 0x00000001
The touchpad applies less mouse input suppression after keyboard activity.
TOUCHPAD_SENSITIVITY_LEVEL_MEDIUM_SENSITIVITY
Value: 0x00000002
The touchpad applies its default level of mouse input suppression after keyboard activity.
TOUCHPAD_SENSITIVITY_LEVEL_LOW_SENSITIVITY
Value: 0x00000003
The touchpad applies more mouse input suppression after keyboard activity.
TOUCHPAD_SENSITIVITY_LEVEL_LEAST_SENSITIVE
Value: 0x00000004
The touchpad applies its maximum amount of mouse input suppression after keyboard activity.
Remarks
The touchpad sensitivity setting causes the touchpad to suppress generation of mouse input after the user has typed on their keyboard. A higher sensitivity means the touchpad is more sensitive to touchpad input and does not suppress mouse input generation as much after keyboard activity.

TOUCHPREDICTIONPARAMETERS structure (winuser.h)
Contains hardware input details that can be used to predict touch targets and help compensate for hardware latency when processing touch and gesture input that contains distance and velocity data.

Syntax
C++
typedef struct tagTouchPredictionParameters {
  UINT cbSize;
  UINT dwLatency;
  UINT dwSampleTime;
  UINT bUseHWTimeStamp;
} TOUCHPREDICTIONPARAMETERS, *PTOUCHPREDICTIONPARAMETERS;
Members
cbSize

The size of this structure, in bytes.

dwLatency

Latency in milliseconds.

dwSampleTime

Sample time in milliseconds (used to calculate velocity).

bUseHWTimeStamp

Use timestamps provided by the hardware.

Remarks
By default, touch prediction is activated. For information on getting pointer data without deactivating touch prediction, see GetUnpredictedMessagePos.
